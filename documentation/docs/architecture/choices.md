## Plugin separation between frontend and backend

We believe than nothing is perfect, and the best we can provide is what we have in mind <br/>
That's why we decided to make the architecture as flexible as possible without creating too
many bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
The separation between frontend and backend for the plugin allows developers to be able to
use their own homemade plugins if the existing ones are not corresponding to their requirements.
<br/>
If the backend plugin is perfect for you, but the frontend one as limitations. Then free to you
to use only the backend one and make your own frontend to communicate with it
