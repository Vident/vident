A plugin is a piece of code which can be understood by the Vident Core App <br/>
They can be either frontend or backend or both!

## Backend

Backend plugins main goal is to extend the API by adding new routes, login and access to the database

## Frontend

Frontend plugins are mostly pieces of UI which can either be used standalone or can communicate
with a backend plugin (most times, the same plugin)
